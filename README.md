Task-1

Business Sales Performance Analytics is an internship-based project focused on analyzing organizational sales data to measure performance and support business decision-making. The project was developed using Power BI, a business intelligence tool by Microsoft, to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate overall sales performance, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and identify trends across products, regions, and time periods. Sales data from sources such as Excel or CSV files was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis.

Key metrics analyzed in the project include total sales revenue, total profit, profit margin, quantity sold, average order value, and sales growth on a monthly and yearly basis. Using DAX functions, calculated measures were created to derive insights such as year-over-year growth and profitability analysis.

Multiple dashboards were designed, including a Sales Overview Dashboard to monitor overall performance, a Product Performance Dashboard to identify top and low-performing products, and a Regional Sales Dashboard to analyze location-wise sales trends. Interactive filters and slicers were used to enable dynamic exploration of data.

Through this analysis, the project helped identify high-revenue products, underperforming regions, seasonal sales patterns, and opportunities to improve profitability. The dashboards provide clear visual insights that assist management in making data-driven decisions.







TASK-2

Customer Retention & Churn Analysis – Project Matter
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify the key factors that lead to customer churn and to improve customer retention strategies. Using historical customer data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand patterns related to customer tenure, subscription type, usage behavior, and billing details.
Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling were applied to prepare the dataset for modeling. Multiple machine learning models were built to predict customer churn, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with special emphasis on recall to correctly identify customers likely to churn.
The analysis revealed that customers with shorter tenure, higher monthly charges, and month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn. Based on these insights, actionable business recommendations were provided, such as personalized offers for high-risk customers, improved onboarding for new users, and promotion of long-term subscription plans.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow and provides valuable insights to help businesses reduce customer churn and improve overall customer satisfaction.
